# Instance Timer

Instance timer is an addon for Wildstar. It's written to keep track of time in adventures, battlegrounds and dungeons. It also pops up a countdown timer when you enter a dungeon.

## To Do

Before Version 1.0;

* Find a way to get the instance start time so the countdown will be viable even if you enter an in-progress dungeon.
* Translation of notification messages to German and French.
